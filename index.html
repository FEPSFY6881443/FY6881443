         This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogenous 
         classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared
         to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
         We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
         active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that...We conclude that...

         When people commonly think of 3D printers, they usually think of home printers which 
         they use to print small parts that in some cases items they could have bought for 
         cheaper if they went to a store. NASA has begun improving 3D printer technology in 
         order to be used in space. An issue NASA has to address frequently when it comes to
         launches, is how to bring the most weight into space,  while having the rocket able to 
         escape the earth’s pull. A 3D printer would allow equipment to not be brought up all 
         together, but to be printed on the spot in the ISS.  Furthermore, incidents such as the 
         one on November 1st 2023 (https://eu.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/12/02/astronaut-lost-tool-bag/71719486007/)  when, during a spacewalk, the astronauts lost a tool bag causing 
         them to be unable to conduct repairs until another set was sent in a supply run through 
         a new launch. The process of launching a rocket into space is costly and takes time due 
         to the amount of preparation that needs to be done, which usually takes up to several 
         weeks, and if the tools lost were urgent this would be a critical problem for the 
         astronauts. Thankfully, the tools lost didn’t cause much disruption and were replaced 
         on the 11th of November through a Space X resupply. These types of situations will be 
         avoided with 3d printing technology as astronauts themselves will be able to produce 
         tools on demand without a need to wait for a resupply, provided that all space agencies 
         resolve certain engineering issues related to this technology which will be discussed 
         below.

      <p class="ex1">

         The main concerns with this implementation of 3d printer technology is the type of
         material to be make 3d printing efficient. NASA in their article stated that RTM370 
         composites are to be used, RTM370 being a polymer resin developed by NASA which
         has high chemical and mechanical resistance. This equals to high durability and 
         material performance when temperatures rise  above 300 degrees celsius.   
         Additionally, NASA reports that these polymers do not harm the environment through 
         their production process. One major disadvantage is the high cost machinery and 
         engineering process needed for producing this polymer.  Consequently, RTM370 may 
         not be as cost effective for larger scale projects but other materials  could be used for 
         this application (cite as https://www-sciencedirect-com.surrey.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0094576524001322) such as the ones illustrated in the table below

         As can be seen from the table above, these materials have a very high melting temperature and due to this high temperature they are also move able to resist UV radiation
         allowing them to remain in use for longer without needing replacement.

         The 3d printing process can also be referred to as additive manufacturing. Given its engineering process, objects are constructed layer by layer, allowing them, in theory to be taken apart also layer by layer.
         This means that all materials used can be recycled and recycled for future printing. In addition, NASA has developed a device that ‘enables recycling of scrap and waste plastics into high-quality filament for 3D printers to enable sustainable in-situ manufacturing on the ISS and future deep-space manned missions.’ Called the the positrusion ISS Recycler (https://techport.nasa.gov/projects/34152).
