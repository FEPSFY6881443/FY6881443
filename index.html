         This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogenous 
         classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared
         to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
         We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
         active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that...We conclude that...

         When people commonly think of 3D printers, they usually think of home printers which they use to print small parts 
         that in some cases items they could have bought for cheaper if they went to a store. NASA has begun improving 3D printer technology in order 
         to be used as it is now but in space. An issue NASA has to address frequently when it comes to launches, is how to bring the most weight into space, 
         while having the rocket able to escape the earth’s pull. A 3D printer would allow equipment to not be brought up all together, but to be printed on the spot in space. 
         Furthermore, incidents such as when in November 11th 2023, during a spacewalk, the astronauts lost a tool bag. Now this might seem like a minor inconvenience, 
         but replacing lost tools is a costly process and not to mention time consuming, as a resupply would need to be sent. With this 3d printer technology, 
         such incidents would not have be as serious and could be resolved for a lower cost.

         The main issue with this implementation of 3d printer technology is what material could be used in order to be able to use the printers. NASA in their article stated to use RTM370 composites, 
         RTM370 being a polymer resin developed by NASA which has high chemical and mechanical resistance, meaning high durability and can perform for temperatures even above 300 degrees celsius. 
         Additionally, NASA reports that these polymers do not harm the environment through their production process. One major disadvantage is the high cost machinery and process needed for this polymer. 
         This causes it to not be as cost effective for larger scale projects. other materials that could be used for this application could be 
         (cite as https://www-sciencedirect-com.surrey.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0094576524001322) the ones illustrated in the table below
