         This article presents the adaptation of current 3d printer technology(also known as 
         additive manufacturing) into a form able to be used in space. This was seen through an 
         analysis of the process and the materials used in the process. Additionally, this article
         also asks about certain ethical aspects to this technology that do not currently have a definitive 
         answer.

      <pre>
         When people commonly think of 3D printers, they usually think of home printers which 
         they use to print small parts that in some cases items they could have bought for 
         cheaper if they went to a store. NASA has begun improving 3D printer technology in 
         order to be used in space. An issue NASA has to address frequently when it comes to
         launches, is how to bring the most weight into space,  while having the rocket able to 
         escape the earth’s pull. A 3D printer would allow equipment to not be brought up all 
         together, but to be printed on the spot in the ISS.  Furthermore, incidents such as the 
         one on November 1st 2023 (USA Today, 2023)  when, during a spacewalk, the astronauts lost a tool bag causing 
         them to be unable to conduct repairs until another set was sent in a supply run through 
         a new launch. The process of launching a rocket into space is costly and takes time due 
         to the amount of preparation that needs to be done, which usually takes up to several 
         weeks, and if the tools lost were urgent this would be a critical problem for the 
         astronauts. Thankfully, the tools lost didn’t cause much disruption and were replaced 
         on the 11th of November through a Space X resupply (USA Today, 2023). These types of situations 
         will be avoided with 3d printing technology as astronauts themselves will be able to produce 
         tools on demand without a need to wait for a resupply, provided that all space agencies 
         resolve certain engineering issues related to this technology which will be discussed 
         below.

      <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
         The main concerns with this implementation of 3d printer technology is the type of
         material to be make 3d printing efficient. NASA in their article stated that RTM370 
         composites are to be used, RTM370 being a polymer resin developed by NASA which
         has high chemical and mechanical resistance. This equals to high durability and 
         material performance when temperatures rise  above 300 degrees celsius.   
         Additionally, NASA reports that these polymers do not harm the environment through 
         their production process. One major disadvantage is the high cost machinery and 
         engineering process needed for producing this polymer.  Consequently, RTM370 may 
         not be as cost effective for larger scale projects but other materials  could be used for 
         this application (Seijas, M. (2024)) such as the ones illustrated in the table below
       <a  href=”https://www-sciencedirect-com.surrey.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0094576524001322”> Seijas, M. (2024).</a>, Table 1: Possible polymers that would be suitable for 3d printing in space

         As can be seen from the table above, these materials have a very high melting temperature and due to this high temperature they are also move able to resist UV radiation
         allowing them to remain in use for longer without needing replacement.

      <h3 id=”Recycling”>Recycling</h3>
      <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
       The 3d printing process can also be referred to as additive manufacturing. Given its 
       engineering process, objects are constructed layer by layer, allowing them, in theory to 
       be taken apart also layer by layer. This means that all materials used can be recycled 
       and recycled for future printing(National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2014)). 
       In addition, NASA has developed a device that ‘enables  recycling of scrap and waste plastics into 
       high-quality filament for 3D printers to enable sustainable in-situ manufacturing on the ISS and 
       future deep-space manned missions.’ called the the positrusion ISS Recycler (NASA (2017)) as shown below.
       <img src="positrusiionNASA.jpg" alt="Positrusion ISS recycler" width="300" length="300">
       This ability to recycle and reuse materials in the ISS can ease concerns about the 
       amount of space junk created and orbiting debris around Earth.

      <h3 id=”Ethical”>Ethical engineering and industrial considerations</h3>
      <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
       When new technologies are made, there are naturally concerns to their use. This is the
       same with this technology, where there are several questions that serve as food for 
       thought, especially as this technology develops.

       Firstly, how would the issue of open source designs be handled? In order for the 3d 
       printer to produce an construct, there must be a design supplied to it. Will these 
       designs be remade by each space agency or will there be open source designs available 
       to be used. On the topic of open source, will these 3d printers suitable for space be 
       given to other space agencies that haven’t developed the technology yet or will it be 
       kept privatised? If it is kept private, this will surely cause the agencies without the
       technology to be unable to conduct their scientific mission as effectively as those with 
       it.

       In addition, are engineers ethically obligated to thoroughly test 3d printed components 
       before development? Additive  manufacturing is able to create complex lightweight 
       structures but as seen with current versions of this technology these designs need 
       thorough testing in order to guarantee their ability to survive in the intense conditions in 
       space. If this components are rushed it could cause major accidents, especially in the 
       sector of aerospace, where one small error can cause accidents to happen.

       Lastly, can engineers prioritise the sustainability of the materials used in additive 
       manufacturing over its functionality? As mentioned above in the material analysis 
       section, NASA specifically, have some polymers which would be suitable for use on the 
       field but it’s been mentioned that they plan to try to use materials from the planet the 
       expedition is on, such as lunar regolith, which is the dust and crushed rock found on the 
       surface of planets and moons(Hall, C. (2024)) . Is mining planets to supply material ethical? 
       Should we harvest planets like we’ve done to Earth? These are questions that don’t have definitive 
       answers for this material alternative, and is an example of how sustainability should be considered.

      <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
      In conclusion, 3d printing can be a technology that can make space travel and 
      exploration easier and more efficient and is becoming a reality. Although, as mentioned 
      in the article, the technology still has some ethical considerations that need to be fully 
      addressed in order to not cause inadvertent effects on others as a consequence.
